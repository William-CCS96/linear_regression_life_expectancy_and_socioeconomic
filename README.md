## Introduction
This project aims to generate a multivariable linear regression model to predict life expectancy with social and economic variables from different years and regions of the world. The "Life expectancy & Socio-Economic (world bank)" Dataset was used.

The work is carried out around the analysis, compression, validation, cleaning of the data for its proper use in the training of the model, with the following work path:

- Development
- Understanding the data
- Simple linear regression
  - Adjust null values
  - Create the model
  - Evaluate the model
  - Create predictions
- Multivariable regression
  - Data purification and cleaning
  - Adjust null values
  - Analyze the data
  - Correlation matrix 
  - Convert categorical variables to numeric, with One-hot encoding
  - Model training
  - Evaluating the model
  - Improving the model
  - Dimensionality reduction
